<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>Bespoke was born out of a desire to bring tailored wedding registries to South Africans frustrated by the limited options available to them. London-born Bespoke founder Laura Hau saw the need for more personalised gifting when she married her South African husband and realised how little choice there was in a country where department store shopping doesn't exist.  </p>
<p>Laura created a list of her favorite brands and stores around Cape Town and partnered with them to offer Bespoke clients an array of the finest homeware and the chance to style their homes exactly how they choose.</p>

<p>Working with Laura and Bespoke has been a pleasure from the beginning. Laura is gentle and professional and all her products are of the highest quality, not to mention beautiful! I highly recommend the Bespoke team for the most spectacular service and wedding registry. The Bespoke team ensure you a seamless, easy, fun and relaxed wedding gift selection process. Every bride needs to use Bespoke! It’s by far the most relaxed and fun part of the wedding planning! Imagine all the wonderful items you have seen in all the shops over the years and saying to yourself “I would LOVE that in my home.” Now I have every one added to my wedding registry! Thank you Bespoke. Sadly I won’t be getting married again, but perhaps you could also offer a birthday gift registry? As I think it’s the easiest and most stress-free way of shopping for one’s friends. </p>
