<h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>

<p>Terms and Conditions of Bespoke Wedding Registry incorporating the wedding registry procedures. To avoid confusion, we believe it is in your own interest to understand how our wedding registry service operates. Our terms and conditions (incorporating the wedding registry procedures) are set out below:</p>
<div id="terms" class="content-outer">

<div class="content-inner terms-conditions">

<ol>
	<li>In these terms and conditions Bespoke Wedding Registry is variously referred to as “Bespoke”, “our” “we” or “us” and the client is referred to as “client” “you” or “your”. </li>
	<li>The wedding registry procedure is set out at Schedule A and forms part of these terms and conditions. In the event of any contradiction between the wedding registry procedure and these terms and conditions, then these terms and conditions shall prevail. </li>
	<li>Changes of address including email address and telephone numbers, additions and amendments to your wedding registry and all notices from you to us must be made in writing (including email). Additions and amendments to the wedding registry will be accepted provided the items concerned have not already been selected, ordered or reserved. </li>
	<li>Subject to the provisions of clause 15, we regret that items specified on your wedding registry may not be changed or returned after we have received a signed purchase order for the items from you. </li>
	<li>You will be notified of selections made from your wedding registry by the method of communication chosen by you. Please note that if you choose our on-line service we cannot be responsible for the contents of the messages that may be sent by any of the guests who select items from your wedding registry. </li>
	<li>Our aim is to make the first delivery to you, which may be a part shipment, approximately two weeks from the date we receive your signed purchase order. However, it should be understood that the order of some items may take suppliers several months to process and deliveries from suppliers can be delayed. Where this occurs we will endeavour to notify you and advise you of the expected delivery time but we cannot be held responsible for any delays or misinformation by suppliers. </li>
	<li>We regret we cannot guarantee the availability of any item on your wedding registry. If an item becomes unavailable, you will be required to make an alternative choice. You should understand that it is not always possible to advise that an item is not available at the time you place an order. </li>
	<li>Prices quoted on the list may be increased without prior notice. We are unable to include any sale merchandise on your wedding registry. </li>
	<li>Prior to ordering your wedding registry there will be no interest to you on monies held by Bespoke in respect of your wedding registry. </li>
	<li>If you wish, orders may be made on your behalf for presents that are not normally held in stock by our 	suppliers. In these circumstances, a purchase order will be raised and you will be required to sign this before the order is processed. We will take payment for any amount over and above the funds available from your wedding registry at the time of the order. When your wedding registry closes you can receive a credit against the additional monies accrued on your wedding list.</li>
	<li>Should you choose unique items, such as antiques, we may ‘reserve’ them for you at your request and the conditions contained in clause 11 apply. </li>
	<li>Once you have confirmed your purchasing requirements, the ordering of your gifts is not undertaken until the purchase order raised by Bespoke is received, duly signed by you and any outstanding 	balance due to Bespoke has been settled. Purchase orders are only accepted when hand delivered, mailed, faxed or emailed to us through our on-line service using your unique ID password. </li>
	<li>If a guest selects a gift after you have signed your purchase order, the value of the gift will be added to your account and not purchased unless you request a further purchase order to be raised. </li>
	<li>Every delivery is accompanied by an itemised delivery note. If the goods we deliver are not what you ordered or are damaged or defective or the delivery is of an incorrect quantity, we shall have no liability to you unless you notify us by email of the problem within ten working days of the delivery of the goods in question. </li>
	<li>Money from your wedding registry account cannot be used to purchase gifts from other wedding registries registered with us. </li>
	<li>At the purchasing stage, should you wish to specify alternative gifts not itemized on your original wedding registry, changes are only accepted if available from one of our approved suppliers. All monies received from your guests must be allocated to your wedding registry and no cash payments or refunds will be made to you. </li>
	<li>We will store your wedding presents without charge for up to six months from the date that we receive them, following which you will have to pay a storage charge. </li>
	<li>We require at least two working days notice to arrange delivery. We allow two free delivery services per wedding registry within the central Cape Town area. Gifts to other areas of South Africa will be delivered at an additional cost to you. Export shipping service available. </li>

Upon receipt of this payment from you, all guests will be refunded the amount of their gift and will be advised in writing that a credit has been issued. </li>
