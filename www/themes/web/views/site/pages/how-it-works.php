<p>Upon registering, you'll be assigned a personal Bespoke consultant to guide you through the process. Together, we'll discuss your requirements and visit our affiliated stores to select the perfect items for your registry. You'll be given complimentary Bespoke notification cards to pop into your invitations and inform your guests of your wedding registry. </p>

<p>Next, we'll create your very own Bespoke webpage with your wish-list of items. Guests will be able to access the page and either purchase individual items or contribute towards bigger ones, like furniture or art.</p>
<p>You'll be able to keep track of everything that's been purchased and by whom, and you'll even have the option of changing your purchased items before closing your registry.</p>

<p>Finally, 2-3 weeks after the close of your registry, your gifts will be beautifully wrapped and hand-delivered to your door.</p>
